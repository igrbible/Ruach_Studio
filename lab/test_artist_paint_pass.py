"""HERESY 2230: the painter's pass at the end of an upscale in passes (lab/artist.py), on a kit of its own in a temporary folder (never this
Studio's), no card and no painter: an upscale in passes asked with a painter's pass keeps it on its run (the source run's painter, fine-tune,
adapters without their sizes, sampling; how much it may change and the extra noise); the passes that cannot take one refused with the reason
(ending at ×4, a long side after them, Qwen-Image 2.1's picture, an upscaled picture, a strength out of range, the pictures picked); when the
upscale's run is done its work asks draw() over the chain's picture at ×2, the run's prompt and seed, and keeps the new run's id; a refusal of
draw kept as paint_error and said, never taken for a pass that ran; a stopped or failed upscale asks for none; and draw() itself takes the
chain's picture as its reference at scale 2 (its ask: scale, nearest, strength, inject). HERESY 2259: a long side no longer refuses the pass
(Viktor's 8K chain, ×2 ×4 ×1.5 ×2 then 7680): the chain lands at its last factor, the long side and the colours ride on the pass as «then»,
draw() keeps them on the painter's run, and when that run is done a finish run of its own is asked (no model), which brings the painted picture
to its long side by Lanczos and puts the colours of the picture the passes began from back on it. Under a few seconds.
